## Overview

This project is a full-stack web application that allows a hotel to manage bookings. It includes a user-friendly interface for hotel managers to add, view, and delete bookings. The application is built using JavaScript, React for the front-end, Express for the back-end, and MongoDB for data persistence.

## Features

- **View Bookings**: Hotel managers can view a list of all bookings made at the hotel.

- **Add New Booking**: Hotel managers can add new bookings by providing the following information:
  - Guest Name
  - Guest Email Address
  - Check-in Status

- **Real-time Updates**: When a new booking is added, the page updates instantly without requiring a page refresh, providing a seamless user experience.

- **Delete Bookings**: Hotel managers have the option to delete bookings if needed.

## Technology Stack
